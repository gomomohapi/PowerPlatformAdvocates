## Introduction to Power Pages Copilot

Power Pages is defined as a secure, enterprise-grade, low-code software as a service (SaaS) platform for creating, hosting, and administering modern external-facing business websites. This tool is designed to empower anyone, whether they are a low-code developer or a professional developer, to create websites quickly and easily. This includes the design, development, configuration, management, and publishing of these websites.

Copilot simplifies this process by generating entire webpages, forms, text, chatbots, and so much more. This is all made possible via a user-friendly, conversational interface that allows you to express what you want to build in plain language and then copilot will generate what you need.

1. From the prompt, Copilot generates a site name and web address. Change the site name to be `Contoso Real Estate`. Then change the web address to be `contosorealestate-xxxx`.

    > **Note:** The `xxxx` in the web address is a unique identifier that Copilot generates. You can change it but it's there to ensure that the web address is unique to you.

    Select **Next**.

1. Now you'll be asked to pick a site layout. You either select _Try Again_ to get a new generated layout or select _Next_ to continue with the current layout. Select **Next** to continue.

1. Copilot then generates more pages that could be used in the site based on the prompt. Select the following pages:

    * **About Us**
    * **Contact Us**
    * **Listings**
    * **Services**
    
    Then select **Done**. 
    
    Copilot will then set up and generate the full site. This may take a few minutes.

    Once  generated, you'll be redirected to the site opened in the design studio where you can further customize the site.
